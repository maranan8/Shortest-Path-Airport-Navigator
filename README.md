# Shortest-Path-Airport-Navigator
My CS2400 final project. It is a program that allows users to query airport information and find the shortest path between airports using Dijkstra's algorithm.

# How to use
- Enter Q to query the airport information by entering the airport code
- Enter D to find the minimum distance between two airports
- Enter H for help
- Enter E to exit the program
